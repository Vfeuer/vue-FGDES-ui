## UI for project AGCCS-CTRL22

This programm aims to develop the user interface for the Combined Charging System from project AGCCS. A supporting server program is needed for regular operation.

The whole work is developed based on Vue.js and uses Element UI as the UI toolkit. Now it has the following 3 main functions:

1. Main console: Check the data of the whole charging mesh, which includes the total and active numbers of charging nodes, the total current value in 3 phases and the setting of mesh.
2. Console of node: Check the status of every node, which includes the settings, connection and status and current value in each phase, and change settings of node.
3. Side menu: switch the console, edit the setting of mesh.
